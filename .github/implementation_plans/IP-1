Implementation Plan: Story 1 â€“ Singlish-Aware Translation (MVP)
1. User Story
As a coffee-lover unfamiliar with Singaporeâ€™s coffee lingo
I want to type in a Singlish or English coffee order and get back a clear, culturally-aware translation
So that I can understand and request my coffee correctly

2. Pre-conditions
Base Next.js project scaffolded

Fine-tuned NLP model artifact available (e.g. HuggingFace endpoint or local container)

Dev AWS account & Lambda/Express skeleton in place

LRU cache library added to dependencies

3. Technical Requirements
Frontend:

Next.js page /translate

React form & API client

Backend:

POST /api/translate service

Integration with NLP model

In-memory LRU cache

CI/CD: GitHub Actions â†’ Vercel (frontend), AWS Lambda or ECS (backend)

4. Implementation Tasks
Task	Owner	Status
1. Scaffold /translate page + form UI	Bob	âœ… Done
2. Create Express/Lambda handler for /api/translate	Carlos	ðŸŸ§ In Progress
3. Wire up NLP model client (REST/gRPC)	Carlos	â¬œ Not Started
4. Implement LRU cache around model calls	Bob	â¬œ Not Started
5. Add client-side form validation (max length, no scripts)	Bob	â¬œ Not Started
6. Configure GitHub Actions workflow	Carlos	â¬œ Not Started
7. Deploy frontend to Vercel & backend to AWS	Carlos	â¬œ Not Started

5. Acceptance Criteria
Entering any coffee phrase returns a translated string within 500 ms (cache hit)

90% of common coffee orders match expected output in our sample test set

UI displays error for API failures or invalid input

6. Modified Files
pages/translate.tsx

api/translate/index.ts (or handler.js)

lib/nlpClient.ts

CI config: .github/workflows/frontend.yml, backend.yml
