Implementation Plan: Story 3 ‚Äì Order History, Privacy Controls & Nerd Reporting
1. User Story
As a data-minded coffee enthusiast
I want to view/delete my past orders and download a JSON ‚Äúnerd report‚Äù
So that I can track my caffeine intake and keep my data private

2. Pre-conditions
Story 2 deployed and stable

Feature-flag system configured (e.g. LaunchDarkly)

orders table has basic records

3. Technical Requirements
UI:

New /history page

List view with ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button per order

‚ÄúDownload JSON Report‚Äù button

API:

GET /api/history?userId=

DELETE /api/history/:orderId (soft delete)

GET /api/history/report?userId=&format=json

DB: add deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ and caffeine_mg INT columns

Feature Flag: wrap history/report rollout

4. Database Schema (Optional Artefact)
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE orders
  ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL,
  ADD COLUMN caffeine_mg INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
5. Implementation Tasks
Task	Owner	Status

6. Acceptance Criteria
History page lists only non-deleted orders, paginated

Clicking ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù marks deleted_at and removes it from the list

‚ÄúDownload JSON Report‚Äù returns a valid JSON array of all orders with caffeine data

Feature flag OFF ‚Üí history routes return 404
