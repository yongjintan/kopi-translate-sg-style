User Story 2: Coffee Ordering via Partner API
As a busy Singaporean
I want to place my translated coffee order directly to a partner café
So that I can skip the queue and have it ready when I arrive

Technical Details
UI

“Order” button on translate result

Modal for size, sugar level, add-ons

Backend

Node.js microservice POST /api/order

Auth: JWT for user sessions

Order service calls partner café REST API (OAuth2 client credentials)

DB

PostgreSQL table orders

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
Infrastructure

Deploy ordering service in ECS (Docker)

Redis for dedupe & retry queue

Estimation
Story points: 20 (~3 weeks)

Dev Tasks
Design & migrate orders table (1 day)

Build React modal & form validations (2 days)

Implement POST /api/order service (2 days)

Integrate OAuth2 & partner API client (3 days)

Wire up JWT auth (1 day)

Deploy Docker service to ECS (2 days)

Testing Estimates
Unit tests (services & components): 12 h

Integration tests (mock partner API): 8 h

E2E tests (full order flow): 6 h

Security
Secure JWT storage (HttpOnly cookies)

Input validation on order payload

Graceful error handling & partner-API timeouts
